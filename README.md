# Unsupervised Machine Learning Analysis-Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
This project aims to use unsupervised learning for clustering cryptocurrency data and creating an analysis for clients who are preparing to get into the cryptocurrency market.

To offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for customers, I create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

## Method:
The data I used is not ideal, so it needed to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what I am looking for, I decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I used a clustering algorithm. I used data visualizations to present findings.

Here are the main steps:
1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
